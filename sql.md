# SQL language

*SQL (Structured Query Language)* is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially  
in a relational database management system (RDBMS). 


## DDL & DML
**Data Definition Language (DDL)** and **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** are two types   
of sublanguages used in SQL for different purposes:  

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: DDL is used to define the structure of the database.  
It deals with database schemas and descriptions of how the data should reside in the database.  
The main DDL commands in SQL include:  

- `CREATE` - to create a database and its objects like table, index, views, stored procedure,  
  function, and triggers.  
- `ALTER` - alters the structure of the existing database.  
- `DROP` - deletes objects from the database.
- `TRUNCATE` - removes all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records.  
- `RENAME` - renames an object.

3. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: DML is used to manipulate the data itself. It deals with  
   data manipulation and includes most common SQL statements.  
   The main DML commands in SQL include:
   
- `SELECT` - retrieves data from one or more tables.
- `INSERT` - inserts data into a table.
- `UPDATE` - updates existing data within a table.
- `DELETE` - deletes all records from a table.
- `MERGE` - UPSERT operation (insert or update).

In summary, `DDL` is used for defining the structure of the database, while `DML` is used for manipulating  
the data within that structure.





## CREATE TABLE

`PRIMARY KEY` is a column or a group of columns used to uniquely identify a row in a table. The primary key  
constraint is a combination of a `NOT NULL` constraint and a `UNIQUE` constraint. This means that the column  
or group of columns defined as the primary key must have non-null and unique values.  

```SQL
CREATE TABLE countries(id serial PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), population INTEGER);
INSERT INTO countries(name, population) VALUES('China', 1382050000);
INSERT INTO countries(name, population) VALUES('India', 1313210000);
INSERT INTO countries(name, population) VALUES('USA', 324666000);
```

## ALTER TABLE

Rename column, add constraint.  

```SQL
ALTER TABLE countries RENAME COLUMN name TO country_name;
ALTER TABLE countries ADD CONSTRAINT country_unique UNIQUE(country_name)
ALTER TABLE countries DROP CONSTRAINT country_unique;
```

Add new column.  

```SQL
ALTER TABLE countries ADD capital_city VARCHAR(255);
```

## UPDATE statement

```SQL
UPDATE countries SET capital_city = 'Beijing' WHERE country_name = 'China';
UPDATE countries SET capital_city = 'New Delhi' WHERE country_name = 'India';
UPDATE countries SET capital_city = 'Washington' WHERE country_name = 'USA';
```

## DROP TABLE

```SQL
DROP TABLE countries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS countries;
```

## delete contents of table

```SQL
DELETE FROM countries WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM countries;
TRUNCATE countries;
```

## SELECT 

Scalar values.  

```SQL
SELECT VERSION();
```

Expressions.  

```SQL
SELECT 3 + 5 as output;
SELECT (3 + 5) * 3 as output;
```

Functions.  

```SQL
SELECT POWER(3, 3), SQRT(81), ABS(-5);
SELECT TRIM(LEADING '.' FROM '...falcon...');
SELECT TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM '...falcon...');
SELECT TRIM(BOTH '.' FROM '...falcon...');
```

```SQL
SELECT 
  TRIM(LEADING '.' FROM '...falcon...') AS trim_leading,
  TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM '...falcon...') AS trim_trailing,
  TRIM(BOTH '.' FROM '...falcon...') AS trim_both;
```

```SQL
SELECT SUBSTRING('an old falcon' from 3);
SELECT SUBSTRING('an old falcon' from 3 for 4);
```

Regex.  

```SQL
SELECT * FROM countries WHERE name ~ 'ia$';
```


Selecting columns.  

```SQL
SELECT * from countries;
SELECT name, population FROM countries;
```

Rename column in output with `AS`. 

```SQL
SELECT id, name as "country name", population FROM countries;
```

Date & time. 

```SQL
SELECT NOW(); -- date and time
SELECT current_date; -- date
SELECT current_time; -- time
```

## IN clause

```SQL
SELECT * FROM countries WHERE id IN (2, 4, 6, 8, 10);
SELECT * FROM countries WHERE id NOT IN (2, 4, 6, 8, 10);
```

## AND/OR 

```SQL
SELECT * FROM countries WHERE (id % 2 = 0) AND (id < 20);
SELECT * FROM countries WHERE name SIMILAR TO '%ia' OR name SIMILAR TO '%an';
```

## LIMIT clause

```SQL
SELECT * FROM countries LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM countries LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
```

## WHERE clause 

```SQL
SELECT name, population FROM countries WHERE id = 5;
SELECT name, population FROM countries WHERE population > 100_000_000;
SELECT name, population FROM countries WHERE population BETWEEN 100_000_000 AND 300_000_000;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM countries WHERE name LIKE 'I%';
```

## COUNT function

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM countries;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countries;
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM countries WHERE population < 50_000_000;
```

## DISTINCT clause

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT(occupation) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM countries;
```



## SUM/AVG functions

```SQL
SELECT SUM(population) FROM countries LIMIT 3;
SELECT AVG(population) FROM countries LIMIT 10;
```


## ORDER BY clause

```SQL
SELECT * FROM countries ORDER BY name;
SELECT * FROM countries ORDER BY name ASC;
SELECT * FROM countries ORDER BY name DESC;
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY occupation, last_name DESC;
```

## COUNT & FILTER 

```SQL

SELECT
  count(1) AS total_countries,
  count(1) FILTER (WHERE population > 100_000_000) AS countries_with_pop_gt_100M,
  count(1) FILTER (WHERE population > 1_000_000_000) AS countries_with_pop_gt_1B,
  count(1) FILTER (WHERE name LIKE '%an') AS countries_ending_with_an
FROM 
  countries
```

## Calculate age

```SQL
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, occupation, dob, 
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) AS age
FROM users;
```

## CASE/WHEN

```SQL
SELECT *,
CASE 
	WHEN population > 1_000_000_000 THEN 'huge' 
	WHEN population BETWEEN 100_000_000 AND 500_000_000 THEN 'large' 
	ELSE 'other'
	END AS population_size
FROM 
  countries
```

```SQL
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, occupation, dob, 
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) AS age,
       CASE 
           WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) < 18 THEN 'minor'
           WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) BETWEEN 18 AND 64 THEN 'adult'
           ELSE 'senior'
       END AS age_group
FROM users;
```

## GROUP BY

```SQL
SELECT occupation, COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
GROUP BY occupation;
```


```SQL
-- SELECT occupation, COUNT(*), array_agg(first_name || ' ' || last_name) as full_name
SELECT occupation, COUNT(*), string_agg(first_name || ' ' || last_name, ';') as full_name

FROM users 
GROUP BY occupation;
```


```SQL
SELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN population >= 1000000000 THEN 'Greater than 1 billion'
    WHEN population >= 100000000 AND population < 1000000000 THEN 'Between 100 million and 1 billion'
    WHEN population >= 10000000 AND population < 100000000 THEN 'Between 10 million and 100 million'
    ELSE 'Less than 10 million'
  END AS population_group,
  COUNT(name) AS number_of_countries,
  SUM(population) AS total_population
FROM 
  countries
GROUP BY 
  population_group
ORDER BY 
  total_population DESC;
```

```SQL
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) < 18 THEN 'minor'
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) BETWEEN 18 AND 64 THEN 'adult'
        ELSE 'senior'
    END AS age_group,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY age_group;
```

```SQL
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) < 18 THEN 'minor'
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) BETWEEN 18 AND 64 THEN 'adult'
        ELSE 'senior'
    END AS age_group,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ARRAY_AGG(first_name || ' ' || last_name) as users_in_agegroup
FROM users
GROUP BY age_group;
```

```SQL
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) < 18 THEN 'minor'
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dob::date)) BETWEEN 18 AND 64 THEN 'adult'
        ELSE 'senior'
    END AS age_group,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    STRING_AGG(first_name || ' ' || last_name, ';') as users_in_agegroup
FROM users
GROUP BY age_group;
```

## HAVING clause

The `HAVING` clause in SQL is used to filter the results of a `GROUP BY` clause, similar to how the   
`WHERE` clause is used to filter the results of a `SELECT` statement.  

```SQL
SELECT occupation, COUNT(*) as user_count
FROM users
GROUP BY occupation
HAVING COUNT(*) IN (1, 3);
```
